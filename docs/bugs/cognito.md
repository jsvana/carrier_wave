# AWS Cognito

**✅ DONE** - Changed tour text from "AWS Cognito" to "External Logins (Google, Apple, etc.)" in MiniTourContent.swift

Justin provided feedback that nobody knows what AWS Cognito is. Very true. We should change the tour for POTA.app to state "external logins" like google and such, or something that's more end user-friendly.
