# Logging QSOs automatically from decoder

I'd like for us to add the ability to transcribe QSOs as heard by the decoder. This'll mean a few things:
1. QSOs are rarely zero-beated. The decoder will need to find the right center tone frequency for each part of the QSO. It should log what it finds.
2. I want to intelligently color parts of the QSO (if it hears UR 599/UR RST 599 it should show signal).
3. It should automatically lookup callsigns it hears as part of the QSO.
5. I want to render each side of the QSO in a chat transcript format.
