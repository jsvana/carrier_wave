# QSO maps

I'd like to add another entry to the dashboard (maybe as a button to link to another pane) to map out QSOs. I want to allow filtering the mapped QSOs various ways (date range, bands, parks, etc). Performance is paramount here--we cannot make calls to determine every operator's location. Using the default system map is fine. Should also have an option to toggle arcs between the ends of each QSO.
