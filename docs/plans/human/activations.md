# New activations pinned to top of POTA log page

**✅ DONE** - Added "Ready to Upload" section at top of POTA activations list showing
pending activations sorted by date descending, with park reference shown in each row.

Let's add a list of all not-yet-uploaded activations by descending activation date. Push the "grouped by park" view down".

Feature request dialog:

I like how the activations are grouped by park. But I think this would lead to new activations getting lost and forgotten about. Or at least, a pain for someone to find when they go there to upload. Could there be a container at the top for new (not yet uploaded) activations? Or at least have option to sort by date completed instead of by park?

That's a solid idea. So, the "grouped by park" stuff maybe gets pushed below, but it shows a log of perhaps the most recent 5 not uploaded QSOs regardless of park, expandable to all?

I’m not sure a limit would be needed/wanted. If it gets capped at, let’s say 5 but someone has 6 new activations, the last one could easily get missed and forgotten about. Or if I did 10 one day, i would want them all at the top and easy to get to.

Okidoke. So you'd be okay pushing the rest downward? Should there even be separation there? (like do we actually want the whole "grouped-by-park" thing)

I see value in the group by park sorting. Just not at the expense of seeing the newest un synced activations at the top. at least for me. I also wouldn’t be heartbroken if they were all just sorted by date for simplicity sake
